Hi! My name is Dylan van Gils. I am a software developer from the Netherlands.

I'm working as an IT consultant in my day-to-day job. Where I mainly focus on building backend systems in the industrial domain. But I also like front-end development, improving productivity by building pipelines and working on the automation of the deployment/configuration of infrastructure.

Outside of my work, I like to exercise. Currently predominantly running and fitness.
